                  you can imagine, since the internet is still in
                  it's infancy, it does conjure up many myths and
                  fears. While most people believe the web is only
                  for national or international businesses, we
                  believe the internet can benefit any business, big
                  or small, local or international. With the
                  explosion of the internet, and more and more people
                  from all walks of life going online daily, a
                  business can not afford to overlook this great
                  marketing resource. One of the common fears is
                  being taken for a ride by someone you do not meet
                  in person. Please be assured that all of our design
                  and maintenance work is completed on a contractual
                  basis so you know before we even start what you
                  will be getting for your expense.<BR>

                  you are having trouble justifying a web presence
                  for your business, think about it this way ... if
                  you had the chance to attend a gathering, at an
                  affordable price, where you could be exposed to
                  hundreds of potential clients and/or customers,
                  wouldn't you go? This is exactly the same thing as
                  advertising on the web, it is your "appearance" at
                  a global gathering but instead of the potential for
                  hundreds of new clients/customers you have exposure
                  to millions.<BR>

                  most often asked question we get from potential
                  clients is "How can the web benefit my business?"
                  This is a very valid question and one that isn't
                  easily answered. For large businesses the benefits
                  are obvious since they are looking for exposure to
                  large amounts of people and other businesses. For a
                  small business the benefits are not as easily seen.
                  Generally a small business has a much smaller
                  advertising budget so they need to be more frugal
                  in their advertising attempts. Having a web site
                  fills the need for exposure to large audiences, the
                  internet has seen a rise from 8% to 32% of the
                  total number of internet surfers who are purchasing
                  items online since 1995 and 22 Million Americans
                  alone log online each and every day, according to

                  While a web site may seem like a large expense, you
